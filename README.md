<h2>Development of a Book on Signals and Systems</h2>
<h3>Project description</h3>

The aim of this project is to start editing a new textbook on "Signals and Systems" in addition to an online ebook version with animated and dynamic illustrations using the Wolfram platform. This ebook version can be opened offline using the free Wolfram CDF player.
In addition, notebook tools (palettes and DockCells) will be developed in order to make editing such a book and others easier for all Wolfram Notebook users.
