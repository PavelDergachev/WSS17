**Summer School Project**
Development of Book Chapters on Signals and Systems
---------------------------------------------------

***Project description***

Based on the famous book "Signals and Systems" 2nd Ed. and co-authored by Pr. Alan V. Oppenheim and  Pr. Alan S. Willsky, the aim of this project is to start a new updated edition of it that includes an online ebook version with animated and dynamic illustrations using the Wolfram platform. This version book can be opened offline using the free eWolfram  CDF player.
In addition, editing tools (palettes and DockCells) will be developped in order to make editing such a book and others, easier for all Wolfram Notebook users.

***Statment of the problem***

The last edition of the book was done more than 20 years, and it's still used in many universities and academic programs. However, one of the main issue is that the concepts are not quite so obvious and students generally face a lot of difficulties to understand manyconceptss Tthe book ncludes i lrage number of static figures in order to illustrate the text however, it remains in many concepts not so easy to master.

***outline of future solution***

The main objectif is to update and convert all included figures and concepts, to animated and living figures and demonstrations, which dynamically change depending on the choice of the professor or the students. This for sure will be a huge improvemenet and achievement in the new edition, and will definitely attract more students and professors too, to adopt this high-tech new edition book.
